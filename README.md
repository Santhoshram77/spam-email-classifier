The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can classify emails as either spam or not spam (ham) based on their content. This is a binary classification problem where the model will learn from a labeled dataset of emails (i.e., emails labeled as "spam" or "ham") to predict the class of unseen emails. The model will use various features extracted from the emails, such as the subject, body text, and metadata, to determine whether an email is spam or not.
